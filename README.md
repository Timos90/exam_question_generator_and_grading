**Exam Question Generator and Grading**
===========================

An automated system for generating customized quizzes and grading answers. This project is ideal for educators who want to create unique quizzes for multiple students and automate the grading process. It leverages Python's file handling and randomization to create tailored question sets and evaluate student responses efficiently.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

### **Prerequisites**

*   Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
    
*   A terminal or command prompt for running the scripts.
    

### **Setup**

1.  bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/your-username/exam\_question\_generator.gitcd exam\_question\_generator
    
2.  **Ensure the required folder structure**:
    
    *   Ensure questions/ and answers/ directories exist in the project root.
        
    *   If they are missing, the scripts will create them automatically.
        
3.  **Install dependencies (if any)**:
    
    *   Currently, this project uses only Python standard libraries.
        

### **Usage**

#### **1\. Generate Quizzes**

Use the generate\_questions\_main.py script to generate quizzes for multiple students:
```sh
python3 -m src.generate_questions_main
```

*   Enter the number of students when prompted.
    
*   The script will generate quiz files in the questions/ folder and corresponding empty answer files in the answers/ folder.
    

#### **2\. Fill in the Answer Files**

Manually open the files in the answers/ folder (e.g., python\_quiz\_answer1.txt) and provide the answers for each student.

#### **3\. Grade Answers**

Run the grade\_answers\_main.py script to grade the answers:
```sh
python3 -m src.grade_answers_main
```

*   Enter the number of students when prompted.
    
*   The script will read the quizzes and answers, calculate scores, and display detailed feedback.
    

### **Example**

1.  **Generate Questions**:
    
    *   Enter the number of students: 2
        
    *   Generated quiz for Student 1 at questions/python\_quiz\_question1.txt
    Generated quiz for Student 2 at questions/python\_quiz\_question2.txt
        
2.  **Grade Answers**:
    
    *   Enter the number of students: 2
        
    *   Results for Student 1:Score: 80%
    Review your incorrect answers:Q: What does 'self' represent in OOP?Correct Answer: The object
    Results for Student 2:Score: 100%
        

**Extending the Project**
-------------------------

### Add More Questions

*   Open src/data.py.
    
 ```python 
"Q:Your Question?": 
"Correct Answer", # Always list the correct answer first 
"Wrong Answer 1", 
"Wrong Answer 2", 
"Wrong Answer 3"
```
    

### Customize Functionality

*   Modify src/quiz.py to change the randomization logic or grading rules.
    
*   Adjust src/generate\_questions\_main.py or src/grade\_answers\_main.py for specific workflows.
