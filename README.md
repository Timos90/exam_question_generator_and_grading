**Getting Started**
-------------------

### **Prerequisites**

*   Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
    
*   A terminal or command prompt for running the scripts.
    

### **Setup**

1.  bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/your-username/exam\_question\_generator.gitcd exam\_question\_generator
    
2.  **Ensure the required folder structure**:
    
    *   Ensure questions/ and answers/ directories exist in the project root.
        
    *   If they are missing, the scripts will create them automatically.
        
3.  **Install dependencies (if any)**:
    
    *   Currently, this project uses only Python standard libraries.
        

### **Usage**

#### **1\. Generate Quizzes**

Use the generate\_questions\_main.py script to generate quizzes for multiple students:
```sh
python3 -m src.generate_questions_main
```

*   Enter the number of students when prompted.
    
*   The script will generate quiz files in the questions/ folder and corresponding empty answer files in the answers/ folder.
    

#### **2\. Fill in the Answer Files**

Manually open the files in the answers/ folder (e.g., python\_quiz\_answer1.txt) and provide the answers for each student.

#### **3\. Grade Answers**

Run the grade\_answers\_main.py script to grade the answers:
```sh
python3 -m src.grade_answers_main
```

*   Enter the number of students when prompted.
    
*   The script will read the quizzes and answers, calculate scores, and display detailed feedback.
    

### **Example**

1.  **Generate Questions**:
    
    *   Enter the number of students: 2
        
    *   Generated quiz for Student 1 at questions/python\_quiz\_question1.txt
    Generated quiz for Student 2 at questions/python\_quiz\_question2.txt
        
2.  **Grade Answers**:
    
    *   Enter the number of students: 2
        
    *   Results for Student 1:Score: 80%
    Review your incorrect answers:Q: What does 'self' represent in OOP?Correct Answer: The object
    Results for Student 2:Score: 100%
        

**Extending the Project**
-------------------------

### Add More Questions

*   Open src/data.py.
    
 ```python 
"Q:Your Question?": 
"Correct Answer", # Always list the correct answer first 
"Wrong Answer 1", 
"Wrong Answer 2", 
"Wrong Answer 3"
```
    

### Customize Functionality

*   Modify src/quiz.py to change the randomization logic or grading rules.
    
*   Adjust src/generate\_questions\_main.py or src/grade\_answers\_main.py for specific workflows.
